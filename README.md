# MakeChangeProject

### Overview of Entire Program

This program simulates a cash register, and provides change to customers in the appropriate denominations.

### Technologies Used

-Java: The program is written entirely in java.

-Conditionals: The program uses a series of if, else if, else statements to determine the type and number of each denomination that needs to be returned to the user.

-Loops: The program uses a loop to keep parsing out the type and amount of each denomination until all the change has been returned to the user.

### How to Run This Program
The user inputs the price of the item they would like to purchase, and how much money they are tendering to buy it.

The program then takes that input, and determines whether they tendered the exact amount needed to buy the item, more than the amount to buy the item, or not enough to buy the item.

If the user tendered more money than the price of the item, the program calculates the total amount of change needed to be returned as well as the specific denominations of change to return to the user.

### Lessons Learned
-Think about the big picture before you start writing your code. Better to think about the structure of your entire program first as opposed to just starting line by line.

-It can be difficult to manipulate data types to present them to the user in an understandable way. Like presenting 33 cents as $0.33 as opposed to 0.329999999.
